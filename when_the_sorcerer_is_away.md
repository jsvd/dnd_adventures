## The Premise

A reclusive sorcerer left his manor yesterday morning, the first time in years. Without his presence to stabilize them, his self-running enchantments have been degrading since. Unknown to anyone, a small group of Kenku broke into the manor that same evening, seeking help for a curse that has stolen their voices. Their presence accelerated the chaos, panicked the manor's guardian, and left them trapped inside. Today, the enchantments have fully broken loose, spilling animated objects into the village festival.

The party must quell the festival chaos, trace it to the manor, survive its defenses, and navigate the three-way conflict between the manor's enchantments, the desperate Kenku, and a spectator guardian that has been doing its job correctly but is now paranoid and aggressive.

### Tone

The adventure moves through three tonal phases:

**Comic chaos** (Part 1, Acts 1-2): Brooms attacking litterers, villagers covered in pie, absurdist mayhem.

**Creeping tension** (Part 1, Acts 3-5; Part 2, Acts 1-3): Something is wrong at the manor, someone else is inside, the house is hostile.

**Moral complexity and emotional payoff** (Part 2, Acts 4-5): The Kenku aren't villains, the spectator isn't evil, and the resolution depends on the party's choices.

# Part 1: Festival in Chaos

**Level:** 1 (characters reach level 2 at end of Part 1)
:
**Duration:** 2.5–3 hours
:
**Tone:** Comic chaos building to tension

## Overview

The party attends a village festival when enchanted objects from a reclusive sorcerer's manor begin attacking townsfolk. They trace the chaos to its source, fight through the manor's outer defenses, and arrive at nightfall, only to find the manor sealed until dawn.

### The Sorcerer's Reputation

The villagers speak of Aldric Vorn with pride, not fear. Ten years ago, he cured a plague that had killed a dozen people in a week. His enchanted scarecrows protect the fields from crows and thieves alike. When a bandit crew threatened the village, he turned them into toads for a week, then released them at the crossroads with a warning they apparently took to heart.

He asks for nothing. He bothers no one. His manor lights flicker on the hill each night like a second moon. But he never comes down. Some say he's cursed. Some say he's grieving. The children dare each other to touch his gate.

Yesterday, for the first time in years, someone saw him walking toward the city at dawn.

Things have been off since: garden tools acting up, scarecrows twitching last night. Today, during the festival, it all broke loose.

## Act 1: The Broom Brigade

The party is at the festival for their own reasons: a job posting, a delivery, a hot meal, or simply rest. Let players establish why they're here before chaos interrupts.

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
The pie-eating contest is in full swing when the first broom hits. A wooden handle cracks across a man's shoulders, scattering crumbs. Another broom hurtles from an alley, sweeping at a child's sticky fingers. Within seconds, five enchanted brooms are attacking anyone holding food, and the crowd scatters.
}}

\column

### Encounter: Animated Brooms

| Creature | Count | CR |
|:---------|:-----:|:--:|
| Animated Broom | 5 | 1/4 |

**Difficulty:** Easy

***Tactics.*** The brooms target anyone holding food or making a mess. They're cleaning implements, and their original purpose bleeds through. They don't pursue fleeing targets who drop their food. They swarm anyone who fights back while still holding a pie.

***Creative Solutions:***
- Herding the brooms into a tent or stall: group Strength check (DC 10)
- Calming them with tidy behavior and soothing words: Arcana or Performance (DC 13)
- Luring them with a trail of crumbs into a confined space

{{note
##### Clue: The Black Feather
One broom trails a large black feather caught in its bristles. It's too big to be from a crow. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check notices it during or after the fight.

Players won't know what this means yet.
}}
:
{{note
##### Class Spotlight: Fighter / Barbarian
Multiple weak enemies swarming civilians. Melee characters shine here — they can protect bystanders, use crowd control, and deal with the swarm through raw damage output.
}}

***Evidence.*** Each broom handle is stamped with a crest: a tower encircled by stars. Any villager confirms it: that's the sorcerer's mark.

### The Village Reeve

After the fight, the village reeve approaches: **Marta Vess**, a practical woman with ink-stained fingers and no patience for nonsense.

She explains: things have been off since yesterday (tools misbehaving, scarecrows twitching last night) but today the enchantments fully broke. This is the third wave since this morning. First the garden tools, then the welcome mat (yes, it tried to smother the baker), now this. Something's wrong at the manor. The sorcerer left yesterday morning, heading toward the city, and hasn't returned.

Marta offers **50 gold** from the village fund, plus whatever the sorcerer himself offers when this is resolved. She stresses that he's good to them; this **isn't a monster hunt. It's a rescue.** Something's wrong.

## Act 2: The Road

The road to the manor climbs through orchards and fields. The afternoon light turns golden. Birds avoid the trees nearest the hill. The air hums faintly, like standing near a storm.

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
The road narrows as it climbs. Apple trees line both sides, heavy with fruit no one has picked. The wind dies. Even your footsteps sound muffled.

Then you hear footsteps coming *down*. A man rounds the bend — old, stooped, hauling a sack over one shoulder. He freezes when he sees you.
}}

### Encounter: Harlan Briggs
:
**Harlan Briggs** is a tenant farmer who works the sorcerer's lower fields. He's heading *away* from the manor, fast, and he doesn't want to talk about why.

**Personality:** Stubborn, frightened, embarrassed. He doesn't want to admit he's scared. He's been laughed at before.

**What he knows** (and will share with persuasion):

| Information | DC | What He Says |
|:------------|:--:|:-------------|
| The sorcerer left | Free | "He walked out at dawn. First time in years. Then the tools went mad." |
| Something's in the manor | DC 10 Persuasion | "I heard screaming up there last night. Not human screaming." |
| He saw the Kenku | DC 12 Persuasion or Insight | "Crow-men. Three nights ago on this road. I told the village. Everyone thought I was drunk." |
| He's afraid | DC 13 Insight | He won't say it outright, but he's terrified. His hands are shaking. |

***If the party helps or reassures him:*** He warns them about the scarecrows — "They've been twitchy since the sorcerer left. Don't make sudden moves." This gives the party advantage on initiative for the scarecrow fight in Act 3.

***If the party ignores or threatens him:*** He hurries away. No bonus.

\column

### Environmental Clues

| Clue | DC | What It Tells |
|:-----|:--:|:--------------|
| Black feathers in brambles | 10 | Multiple creatures passed this way |
| Three-toed tracks in mud | 12 | Non-human, bird-like, recent |
| Broken lockpick in grass | 13 | Someone came prepared for a break-in |
| Claw marks on fence post | 14 | Something fled back toward the manor |

### Garden Tools

As the party climbs, animated garden tools flee past them — a rake, a hoe, a watering can — hurrying *away* from the manor. They're not hostile. They're fleeing. The watering can "whimpers" (sloshing pathetically). Something inside the manor is worse than the objects themselves.

{{note
##### Class Spotlight: Bard / Rogue
Social skills drive this encounter. Persuasion and Insight unlock Harlan's information. A Rogue's keen observation catches his shaking hands; a Bard's reassurance earns the scarecrow warning.

{{footnote PART 1 | FESTIVAL IN CHAOS}}

\page

## Act 3: The Scarecrow

Halfway up the hill, the party passes through the sorcerer's orchards. The scarecrows here aren't decoration; they're guardians.

One of them has malfunctioned.

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
The scarecrow drops from its post. Straw limbs bend at wrong angles. Its burlap face turns toward you, and stitched eyes begin to glow—then flicker. Yellow light pulses unevenly, like a heartbeat skipping.

It lurches forward.
}}

### Encounter: Malfunctioning Scarecrow

| Creature | HP | CR |
|:---------|:--:|:--:|
| Scarecrow (modified) | 27 | 1 |

**Difficulty:** Medium

***Modification: Glitching Glare.*** When the scarecrow uses Terrifying Glare, the target has **advantage** on the saving throw. The enchantment flickers; its paralyzing stare cannot fully lock on.

***Tactics.*** The scarecrow is erratic. It targets the nearest creature, then switches to anyone who damages it. Its movements stutter and jerk.

***Creative Solutions:***
- Fire deals normal damage but also spreads, as the scarecrow is highly flammable
- A DC 13 Arcana check reveals the enchantment is destabilizing and will burn out when the scarecrow is destroyed
- Grappling the scarecrow and pinning it: contested Strength check

{{note
##### Teaching Moment: Saving Throws
This fight introduces the Frightened and Paralyzed conditions via Terrifying Glare. Pause before the first use to explain what's about to happen. "Its eyes flicker — everyone, this is a Wisdom saving throw. Here's how that works."
}}
:
{{note
##### Class Spotlight: Wizard / Sorcerer
Fire vulnerability makes casters shine. An Arcana check (DC 13) reveals the destabilizing enchantment — spellcasters can exploit the glitch where martial characters cannot.
}}

\column

## Act 4: The Manor Gate

The party crests the hill as the sun touches the horizon. The manor looms ahead, a three-story stone building with ivy climbing its walls and light flickering in upper windows.

The iron gate stands ajar. Something forced it open from the outside recently. The hinges are bent.

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
The manor gate hangs crooked on its hinges. Beyond it, a gravel path leads to the front doors, also ajar, also forced.

Standing in the gateway, perfectly still, is a suit of armor. No one is wearing it. A sword floats beside it, point aimed at your chest.

The armor's helmet turns toward you. It raises one gauntleted hand.

**"Entry. Suspended."**
}}


### Encounter: The Gate Guardians

| Creature | Count | CR |
|:---------|:-----:|:--:|
| Animated Armor | 1 | 1 |
| Flying Sword | 1 | 1/4 |

**Difficulty:** Medium

***Tactics.*** The armor holds the chokepoint at the gate. The sword harasses anyone who tries to flank or who stays at range. They fight until destroyed; they cannot recognize authorization without the sorcerer present.

***Creative Solutions:***
- Climbing the wall bypasses the fight but takes time (DC 12 Athletics)
- The armor's joints are damaged. A DC 14 Investigation check reveals a gap where a blade could be wedged to lock its arm
- A DC 15 Arcana check reveals the enchantment is keyed to the sorcerer's presence; without him, the guardians can't be deactivated

***Evidence.*** Both guardians show damage from a previous fight. Claw marks score the armor's breastplate. Black feathers are caught in its joints. Someone fought through here before the party.

{{note
##### Teaching Moment: Multiple Enemies
This fight introduces action economy and positioning. The sword is fragile but mobile; the armor is tough but slow. Reward players who split their attention appropriately.
}}
:
{{note
##### Class Spotlight: Rogue / Artificer
Investigation to find the armor's weak joint, Athletics to climb the wall, thieves' tools on the gate mechanism. Rogues and tinkerers have multiple ways to bypass or undermine this fight.

## Act 5: Nightfall Lockdown

The party defeats the guardians as darkness falls. They approach the manor doors—

—and the doors slam shut.

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
The manor doors swing closed with a sound like a thunderclap. Stone grinds against stone. You hear bolts sliding home, not just at the door, but throughout the building. Windows seal. Shutters lock.

A voice echoes from within, recorded, tinny, familiar:

**"Nightfall protocols engaged. Entry suspended until dawn. Vorn apologizes for the inconvenience."**

The lights in the windows flicker once, then go dark.

You are locked out until morning.
}}

### The Night Scene

The party cannot enter the manor until dawn. This is intentional: a natural long rest, a chance to process the day's events, and an opportunity for atmosphere.
:
***What they hear:***
- Movement inside. Heavy footsteps on the second floor.
- A crash. Glass breaking.
- Voices, not words, but sounds. Something mimicking speech.
- Then silence. Long, heavy silence.

:
***What they can learn:***
- The manor's lockdown is defensive, not hostile. It protects what's inside.
- Someone else is in the manor. Someone who got in before the lockdown.
- The voices they heard weren't human. They weren't quite animal either.

\column
## Dawn

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
The sun breaks the horizon. The hum fades. Stone separates from stone with a grinding whisper. The doors drift open, not wide, just a few inches. Exactly as they were before: ajar, forced, waiting.

The manor is quiet. Quieter than it should be.
}}

### Milestone

The party reaches **level 2**. They've completed a long rest. They enter fresh, but something has been awake in there all night.

# Part 2: The Chaotic Manor

**Level:** 2 (characters reach level 3 at end of Part 2)
:
**Duration:** 2–2.5 hours
:
**Tone:** Tense exploration → moral complexity → emotional climax

## Overview

The party enters the manor at dawn. Inside, they find evidence of a desperate intrusion: a Kenku body, a dying Kenku, signs of a running battle, and two survivors trapped in a cellar. A confused spectator guardian hunts the halls. The resolution depends on whether the party can understand what happened and choose compassion over convenience.

## The Timeline

Four Kenku broke in seeking help for a cursed fledgling who has never spoken an original word. The manor's defenses killed one and badly wounded another. The survivors used mimicry — replaying the sorcerer's recorded voice — to confuse the spectator and escape to the cellar. Now the spectator trusts no voice, and it's hunting.

| When | What Happened | Evidence the Party Finds |
|:-----|:--------------|:-------------------------|
| 2 days ago | 4 Kenku break in through the gate | Damaged gate, claw marks on armor |
| 2 days ago | Rug kills one Kenku in the foyer | Body in rug, black feathers |
| 2 days ago | Spectator leaves one dying in the upper hallway | Dying Kenku against wall, gouged wallpaper |
| 2 days ago | 2 survivors flee to the cellar bolt-hole | Sealed door, faint sounds |
| Yesterday | Kenku go silent, wait | Nothing — silence is the clue |
| Now (dawn) | Party enters, spectator is on edge | — |

\column

## Act 1: The Foyer

The party enters at dawn. The lockdown has lifted. The doors stand ajar, exactly as they were: forced, waiting.

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
The foyer is a wreck. An ornate rug lies in the center of the room, half-buried under furniture: an armchair crushed in its grip, a side table splintered across its surface. The rug shifts. Something is still alive under there.

Black feathers are scattered across the marble floor. A broken shortsword lies near the base of the grand staircase. And caught in the rug's folds, you see a hand. Gray-skinned. Clawed. Still.
}}

### Encounter: Weakened Rug of Smothering

| Creature | HP | CR |
|:---------|:--:|:--:|
| Rug of Smothering (weakened) | 18 | 2 |

**Difficulty:** Easy

***Tactics.*** The rug releases the furniture and attacks the nearest creature. It's sluggish, having spent over a day grappling inanimate objects. It fights until destroyed.

***The Body.*** Once the rug is killed, the party finds a Kenku body tangled in its folds. Gray feathers, a beak frozen in a silent scream, one hand still reaching toward the stairs. Dead since the break-in.

{{note
##### Teaching Moment: Grapple and Restrain
This fight reinforces the grapple and restrain mechanics from the rug's smother attack. Remind players they can use the Help action to assist an ally in escaping, or attack the rug to force it to release.
}}

{{note
##### Class Spotlight: Fighter / Barbarian
Grapple escape and raw damage output. High-Strength characters can break free and destroy the rug while others struggle. Rage damage resistance also helps a grappled barbarian survive.
}}

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote PART 2 | THE CHAOTIC MANOR}}

\page

## Act 2: Exploration

The foyer's twin staircases curve upward to a landing. Hallways branch left and right. Everything is still. Dust motes hang in the morning light.

There are **two routes to the cellar** where the Kenku are trapped:

| Route | Path | Risk |
|:------|:-----|:-----|
| **A: Kitchen** | Foyer → Dining Room → Kitchen → Cellar stairs | Direct, but passes the spectator's patrol |
| **B: Secret Passage** | Foyer → Study → Hidden passage behind bookcase → Cellar (different entrance) | Quieter, but requires DC 14 Investigation (automatic if they read the sorcerer's notes carefully) |

The party doesn't know the routes yet — they discover them through exploration. Both lead to Act 3.

### The Spectator: Roaming Threat

The spectator patrols the manor rather than waiting at a fixed point. When the party makes noise (combat, loud conversation, breaking objects), roll or choose from the table below.

##### Spectator Location
| d4 | Location |
|:--:|:---------|
| 1 | First-floor landing, overlooking the foyer |
| 2 | Upper hallway, near the dying Kenku |
| 3 | Kitchen, blocking the direct cellar route |
| 4 | Ground-floor corridor, between study and dining room |

The spectator moves every 10 minutes (or when the party triggers noise). If the party is cautious (Stealth DC 12 for the group), they can avoid it. If they encounter it early, it delivers its warning telepathically — **"You will explain yourselves. Or you will be removed."** — then moves on, giving them one chance before attacking. The full confrontation happens in Act 4.

\column

### Ground Floor Rooms

**Sitting Room.** Papers scattered, a ransacked drawer — the Kenku searched here. A drawer near the window hums faintly. A minor alarm enchantment is wired to it (DC 12 Perception to hear the hum, DC 12 Arcana or thieves' tools to disarm). Opening it without disarming triggers a chime audible throughout the ground floor — roll on the Spectator Location table.

**Dining Room.** A single chair at a long table. Letters written but never sent. If anyone sits in the chair, it animates briefly — scooting itself in, adjusting posture, offering a napkin from its armrest. Not hostile, just startling. Foreshadows the enchantments' helpful intent.

**Kitchen.** An enchanted kettle sits on the cold stove. If anyone approaches, it heats itself and pours a cup of tea. Accepting triggers a recorded voice — the sorcerer's, warm and distracted: *"Welcome home. The cellar stores are stocked if you need anything. I'll be in the workshop."* This voice is useful later: the Kenku can mimic it, and the spectator recognizes it.

**Study.** Scattered papers on curse theory and enchantment mechanics. The party finds the sorcerer's research notes:

{{descriptive
##### The Sorcerer's Notes
*"The Kenku curse fascinates me. Not the cruelty of it — that's common enough among divine punishments — but the specificity. They lost their voices, yes. But they kept their minds. They can think original thoughts. They simply cannot express them.*

*Telepathy bypasses vocalization entirely. If a Kenku could project thought directly, would the curse recognize it as speech? Or would it slip through?*

*Theoretical. I have no Kenku to test this on, and no reason to seek one out."*
}}

The notes also reference *"the passage behind the third shelf — I really must fix that latch."* A DC 14 Investigation check on the bookcase reveals the hidden passage to the cellar. Characters who read the notes carefully find it automatically.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote PART 2 | THE CHAOTIC MANOR}}

\page

### First Floor

The party must visit the first floor — the Helm of Telepathy is here, not in the ground-floor study.

**Upper Hallway — The Dying Kenku.** Claw marks gouged into the walls. A Kenku slumped against the baseboard, wounds across its chest. Still breathing, barely.

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
The hallway ends in violence. Deep gouges score the wallpaper — four parallel lines, again and again, as if something with claws fought desperately here. A figure lies crumpled against the wall. Another Kenku. This one didn't fall running. The wounds face forward. It fought something off.

It's still alive. Its breathing is shallow and wet. One eye opens as you approach.
}}

The Kenku is beyond saving. The wounds are over a day old and too severe for low-level healing to reverse. The manor's ambient magic has kept it lingering, not healing.

If the party speaks to it or stays near, the Kenku's beak opens. It mimics: a small chirp, a fledgling's voice, unmistakably a child. Then, faintly, in a voice borrowed from one of its companions: *"For her."*

One clawed hand lifts, trembling, and points toward the stairs leading down. It dies.

**Workshop.** Half-finished enchantment projects cover the workbenches: a mirror that reflects the wrong room, a pen that writes what you're thinking, and a **music box with no song**. A DC 13 Arcana check activates the music box — it plays a haunting melody the spectator recognizes. A character carrying the activated music box has **advantage on one Persuasion check** during the spectator parley in Act 4.

A tarnished bronze helm sits in a glass case on the far workbench, gathering dust. This is the **Helm of Telepathy** — the adventure's key item.

{{note
##### Class Spotlight: Wizard / Ranger
Arcana checks on enchantments, Investigation on the sorcerer's notes and the secret passage, Survival for tracking the Kenku's path through the manor. Knowledge-oriented characters piece the story together fastest.
}}

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote PART 2 | THE CHAOTIC MANOR}}

\page

## Act 3: The Cellar Door

The party reaches the cellar via whichever route they chose. A narrow staircase descends into darkness (Route A via the kitchen) or a cramped passage opens into a low-ceilinged tunnel (Route B via the study). Either way, they reach the same heavy wooden door — and sounds from beyond.

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
You hear your own voice. Muffled, coming from behind the door. Words you said in the foyer, scrambled and rearranged. Then a different voice, the sorcerer's recorded tone from the lockdown announcement, clipped short. Then silence. Then a small sound, almost like a whimper.

Something is in there. And it's been listening.
}}

### The Communication Puzzle

The Kenku survivors — one adult and one fledgling — have been trapped in the bolt-hole for nearly two days, silent, terrified. Now they hear new voices. The party must communicate through the door, but the Kenku can only respond in mimicry — sounds they've collected, voices they've heard. This is not a normal conversation.

##### What the Adult Kenku Can Use
| Source | Examples |
|:-------|:---------|
| Sorcerer's voice | "Entry suspended," command words |
| Companion voices | The dead Kenku, the fledgling |
| Manor sounds | Doors, locks, the spectator's hum |
| Collected words | Common phrases from past encounters |

##### What the Fledgling Has
Almost nothing. Chirps. Clicks. Distressed sounds. A few simple words ("no," "help," "please") but no ability to string them into meaning. She has not lived long enough to build a vocabulary.

### How They Respond

| Method | Example |
|:-------|:--------|
| Tone for yes/no | Rising = yes, falling = no |
| Replaying sequences | Sounds in order that tell a story |
| Borrowed phrases | Words from others, stitched together |
| Tapping | Numbers, emphasis, rhythm |

\column

### Example Exchanges

**Party:** "How many of you?"
:
**Kenku:** *Two taps. Then two more, a pause, silence. Four came. Two remain.*

**Party:** "Can you open the door?"
:
**Kenku:** *Straining sounds, a frustrated hiss, the sorcerer's voice: "Entry suspended."*

**Party:** "Why did you come here?"
:
**Kenku:** *The fledgling's cry, small, wordless. Silence. Then: "For her."*

{{note
##### Running the Kenku
Don't try to have a normal conversation. The Kenku can't answer open questions easily. They respond to yes/no questions, react to emotional tone, and tell stories through sequences of sound.

If players get frustrated, that's okay — so are the Kenku. If players find a creative way to communicate (writing under the door, asking only yes/no questions, feeding them phrases to repeat back), reward it.

The emotional beat matters more than the information.
}}

### The Key Moment

If the party recognizes that the Kenku came for the fledgling, if they understand that this was a desperate attempt to save a child, trust is earned.

##### Signals of Trust
| Party Response | Kenku Reaction | Trust Level |
|:---------------|:---------------|:-----------:|
| Hostile ("We're coming to get you") | Dead silence. They won't help. | None |
| Confused but neutral ("We don't understand") | They keep trying, but stay guarded | Partial |
| Recognition ("You came for the child") | A sound almost like a sob. Then: "Yes." | Full |

Trust level affects the final encounter. The Kenku can help — or refuse to.

{{note
##### Class Spotlight: Bard / Cleric
Communication, Insight, and creative social play. High-Charisma characters can read tone, build trust, and find creative workarounds for the mimicry barrier. This is *the* roleplay encounter.
}}

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote PART 2 | THE CHAOTIC MANOR}}

\page

## Act 4: The Spectator

The cellar door conversation is what triggers this. The Kenku mimicking the sorcerer's voice, the party talking back — it all echoes up through the stairwell. The spectator hears its master's voice *again*, and this time it comes to finish things. The party is caught between the sealed door and the guardian.

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
A voice echoes in your mind — not your ears. Telepathic. Ancient. Suspicious.

**"More intruders. The master's voice said many things. None of it was true. You will explain yourselves."**

A floating sphere drifts down the stairs behind you. Four eyestalks. One central eye. It's watching all of you at once.

**"Or you will be removed."**
}}

The spectator isn't malfunctioning — it's traumatized. Two days of Kenku mimicry (replaying the sorcerer's voice to confuse it) have left it paranoid and trusting no one.

### Combat: Confused Spectator

| Creature | HP | CR |
|:---------|:--:|:--:|
| Spectator (confused) | 39 | 3 |

**Difficulty:** Hard (modified by trust)

### Kenku Assistance

| Trust Level | Kenku Action | Effect |
|:-----------:|:-------------|:-------|
| None | Silent, cowering | Spectator fights at full power |
| Partial | Brief burst of mimicry | Spectator wastes first turn; disadvantage on Bite |
| Full | Active, sustained support | Spectator wastes first turn; disadvantage on Bite + Eye Rays |

If the party earned trust, the adult Kenku begins calling out from behind the door. The sorcerer's voice, fragments the spectator has been chasing since the break-in. "Stand down." "Please." "It's me."

The spectator's eyes flicker, confused. It can't tell what's real.

The Kenku are using the same trick that confused the spectator during the break-in. They're not helpless. They're fighting the only way they can.

\column

{{note
##### Alternative: Parley
If the party attempts to negotiate before or during combat, run a skill challenge: **3 successes before 2 failures, DC 13.** Each character can attempt one check per round as an action. Useful skills:

- **Arcana** (DC 13): Understanding the spectator's confusion and explaining what happened to its enchantment
- **Insight** (DC 13): Reading its emotional state and responding to what it actually needs to hear
- **Persuasion** (DC 13): Calm, honest appeal; no lies, no claiming authority
- **Evidence** (DC 10): Showing the dead Kenku, pointing out the timeline, demonstrating knowledge without claiming false authority

**Parley does not end the fight.** Even on success, the spectator snaps (too paranoid to stand down) and attacks. But a successful parley shakes its conviction: it **starts combat with 9 fewer HP** and wastes its first turn regardless of trust level. On failure, the fight begins at full power with only trust-level modifiers.

Playing the **music box** from the workshop gives advantage on one Persuasion check during parley.

##### Class Spotlight: All Classes
This is a multi-solution encounter. Fighters can tank the eye rays, casters can counter or exploit its confusion, rogues can use evidence and Investigation, and bards/clerics can attempt parley. Every archetype has a path to contribution.

## Act 5: Resolution

The spectator is linked to a ward that alerts its master when it enters prolonged combat. Its first fight (the Kenku in the upper hallway) was over in seconds, too brief to trigger the alarm. But a sustained battle against the party crosses the threshold. Aldric feels it and teleports home.

### The Sorcerer Returns

Aldric Vorn teleports directly into the middle of the fight. The spectator freezes. It knows its master.

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
A crack of displaced air. A man appears at the foot of the stairs, between you and the spectator. Middle-aged, disheveled, robes rumpled. He raises one hand toward the spectator without looking at it.

**"Stand down."**

The spectator's eyestalks droop. It drifts backward. The fight is over.

He looks at the sealed door behind you. Then at the party. Then up the stairs, as if seeing the rest of the damage in his mind.

**"What happened to my house?"**
}}

If the party defeats the spectator before Aldric arrives, he teleports in moments later to find the aftermath. Adjust the Read Aloud: he appears, sees the destroyed spectator, and says the same line.

Aldric listens to the party and pieces together what happened quickly. He's saddened by the deaths. The rug's grip was meant to restrain, not kill, and the Kenku's desperation and inability to communicate drove them straight into the spectator.

He turns to the sealed door. He can hear them behind it. A word and a gesture, and the door opens.

### The Cellar

{{descriptive
##### Read Aloud
The door swings open. The cellar is small, a bolt-hole, not a room. Emergency supplies line the walls. Water. Dried food. A bedroll.

Two figures huddle in the corner. One adult Kenku, feathers dull and ragged, watching you with desperate, calculating eyes. And pressed against her side, a smaller shape. A fledgling. Young. Silent.

The fledgling looks at you with eyes that hold a question she cannot ask.
}}

\column

### The Kenku's Story

Through fragments of mimicry, gestures, and whatever communication methods the party has developed, the Kenku explain:

They heard of a sorcerer who studies enchantments. They hoped he might understand curses. They came for the fledgling. She has never spoken an original word. Not one. The curse took her voice before she had a chance to build one.

They didn't come to steal. They came to ask.

They searched the manor for hours. They found nothing that helped. The spectator found them first.

### What the Party Can Do

The sorcerer is present. The Kenku are free. The question is what happens next. The party cannot cure the Kenku curse, but they can advocate:

1. **Suggest the helm** from the sorcerer's workshop, connecting the dots between the telepathy helm and the Kenku curse
2. **Vouch for the Kenku** and explain what they went through, what they lost
3. **Say nothing** and let the sorcerer decide on his own (he will help, but more slowly and cautiously)
4. **Turn them over** to the spectator as intruders (morally ugly, but an option)

Aldric's own research notes (found in the study) theorize about this exact situation. When the party points this out, the wheels turn fast.

When he understands why they came (for the fledgling, for hope) something shifts in his expression.

He asks to see the fledgling. He looks at her for a long moment.

Then he asks the party: "What would you have me do?"

### The Helm of Telepathy

If the party suggests the helm (or Aldric arrives at the idea himself), he nods slowly.

He retrieves it. He modifies it, a few minutes of work, adjusting the enchantment.

He kneels before the fledgling and places the helm on her head.

{{descriptive
##### The Fledgling's First Words
The room goes quiet. The fledgling's eyes widen. Her beak opens—but no sound comes out.

Instead, a voice appears in your mind. Small. Tentative. Her voice. Not mimicked. Not borrowed.

Her first original words.

What she says is up to her. But she's crying. And so is the adult Kenku behind her.
}}

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote PART 2 | THE CHAOTIC MANOR}}

\page

### Aftermath

Aldric offers the party their reward: gold, a minor magic item, his gratitude. But he's distracted. He keeps looking at the Kenku.

He asks if they'd like to stay. Just for a while. He has research to do. And for the first time in years, he has a reason to do it.

The fledgling looks at the adult. The adult looks at the party.

What happens next is up to the table.

### Milestone

The party reaches **level 3**. They've completed a two-part adventure, navigated moral complexity, and earned an ending that mattered.

## Closing Notes

This adventure is built to teach: fast first combat, clear clues, escalating stakes, and a finale with multiple solutions. Keep descriptions tight, call for simple DCs, reward clever play, and let the emotional moments breathe.

The sorcerer's sadness, the Kenku's desperation, and the fledgling's silence are the heart of Part 2. Don't rush them. The mechanics exist to support the story, not replace it.

## Consequences and Failure

Not every table reaches the best ending. The adventure's emotional impact depends on real stakes — the party's choices must matter, and that means failure is possible.

### Outcome Table

| Outcome | What Happens |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **Dark ending** | Party sides with the spectator or attacks the Kenku. The fledgling is handed over or killed. The sorcerer arrives to find the party complicit. He's horrified. No reward, no gratitude — just a quiet "Please leave my home." The quest is technically complete (enchantments stabilize) but the moral cost is clear. |
| **Pyrrhic victory** | Party defeats the spectator but never earns Kenku trust. The Kenku flee at first opportunity, taking nothing. The sorcerer arrives, pieces together what happened, and is devastated by the missed connection. He pays the party but the emotional climax never happens. |
| **TPK / Retreat** | The spectator drives off or kills the party. It levitates unconscious PCs outside the manor and seals the door — it "removes" intruders, it doesn't execute them. The party wakes outside at dawn, locked out, having failed. The sorcerer arrives hours later, finds the mess, and eventually discovers the Kenku himself. The resolution happens off-screen. |

### Spectator Defeat Behavior

If the spectator drops the entire party, it does **not** kill unconscious PCs. Its directive is to protect the manor, not to slaughter. It levitates fallen intruders outside, seals the doors, and resumes patrol. The party wakes outside at dawn with 1 HP each.

# Appendix A: NPCs

## Marta Vess
*Village Reeve*

**Appearance:** A practical woman in her forties with ink-stained fingers, gray-streaked hair pulled back severely, and the permanent squint of someone who reads too much by candlelight.

**Personality:** No-nonsense, efficient, protective of her village. She doesn't waste words but isn't unkind.

**Voice:** Clipped sentences. Gets to the point. "That's the sorcerer's mark. Something's wrong up there. Fifty gold if you fix it."

**Role:** Quest-giver in Part 1. Provides payment and closure if the party returns.

:

## Harlan Briggs
*Tenant Farmer*

**Appearance:** Old, stooped, sun-weathered. Calloused hands that won't stop shaking. Hauling a sack of belongings like he's never coming back.

**Personality:** Stubborn, frightened, embarrassed. He's been laughed at before and doesn't want to seem foolish. But he's terrified.

**Voice:** Gruff, reluctant. "I'm not drunk and I'm not crazy. I know what I saw."

**Role:** NPC encounter on the road in Part 1. Provides exposition about the Kenku sighting and the sorcerer's departure. Can warn the party about the scarecrows.

:

## Aldric Vorn
*The Sorcerer*

**Appearance:** Middle-aged, disheveled, robes that were once fine but are now perpetually rumpled. Kind eyes behind thick spectacles. Moves with the distracted energy of someone whose mind is always elsewhere.

**Personality:** Brilliant, lonely, kind. He built his manor to need no one, and now realizes that was a mistake. He cares deeply but shows it awkwardly.

**Voice:** Rapid, tangential, prone to trailing off mid-sentence. "Yes, the enchantments, they're calibrated for my presence, you see, without my aura to—sorry, that's not helpful, is it?"

**Role:** Absent for most of the adventure. His reputation drives Part 1; his return resolves Part 2.

:

## The Adult Kenku
*Survivor*

**Appearance:** Sleek black feathers now dull and ragged from hiding. Sharp eyes that miss nothing. Moves with the coiled tension of someone expecting violence.

**Personality:** Desperate, protective, grieving. Lost two companions to this manor. Will do anything to save the fledgling.

**Voice:** Mimicry only. Fragments of the sorcerer's recorded voice, sounds collected over years, the voices of the dead. Communicates through tone, sequence, and gesture as much as sound.

**Role:** The party's window into the Kenku's story. Their bridge to earning trust.

## The Fledgling
*The Child*

**Appearance:** Small, young, feathers still soft. Eyes too large for her face. Silent in a way that feels heavy.

**Personality:** Curious despite everything. Watches the party with intensity. Wants desperately to communicate but has almost no vocabulary to draw from.

**Voice:** Chirps. Clicks. A few borrowed words ("no," "help," "please") but nothing she can call her own. Until the helm.

**Role:** The emotional core of the adventure. The reason the Kenku came. The payoff if the party chooses compassion.

:

## The Spectator
*Guardian*

**Appearance:** A floating sphere roughly four feet in diameter. One large central eye, four smaller eyestalks. Chitin-plated and ancient.

**Personality:** Dutiful, confused, traumatized. Has served the sorcerer for thirty years. Doesn't understand why its master's voice has been lying to it.

**Voice:** Telepathic. Formal, suspicious, wounded. "The master's voice said many things. None of it was true. You will explain yourselves."

**Role:** The final obstacle in Part 2. Can be fought, placated, or both. Not evil, just doing its job in impossible circumstances.

{{note
##### Roleplaying the Spectator
The spectator isn't evil. It's been tricked, confused, and is now deeply suspicious of everyone. It genuinely believes it's protecting the manor.

If the party attempts to reason with it, it listens, but it's been burned. Any claim to be authorized, any mention of the sorcerer's name, makes it *more* suspicious, not less.

What works: Evidence. Showing it the Kenku bodies. Explaining the timeline. Demonstrating that you know what happened without claiming false authority. Playing the **music box** from the workshop — the spectator recognizes the melody and becomes momentarily less hostile (advantage on one Persuasion check).

What doesn't work: Lying. Claiming to speak for the sorcerer. Using the sorcerer's name as a password.

___
***Create Food and Water.*** The spectator magically creates enough food and water to sustain itself for 24 hours.

***Confused State (Partial or Full Trust).*** If the party earned at least partial Kenku trust, the spectator wastes its first turn in combat as mimicked voices paralyze it with indecision. It also has disadvantage on Bite attacks for the rest of the fight.

***Kenku Interference (Full Trust Only).*** If the party earned full Kenku trust, the spectator also has disadvantage on Eye Ray attacks as the Kenku actively distract it with sustained mimicked voices throughout the fight.

### Actions
***Bite.*** *Melee Attack:* +1 to hit, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 2 (1d6 - 1) Piercing damage.

***Eye Rays.*** The spectator shoots up to two of the following magical eye rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90 ft. It can use each ray only once on a turn.

*1. Confusion Ray.* *Wisdom Save:* DC 13. *Failure:* The target can't take reactions until the end of its next turn. On its turn, the target can't move, and it uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined creature within range. If the target can't attack, it does nothing on its turn.

*2. Paralyzing Ray.* *Constitution Save:* DC 13. *Failure:* The target is Paralyzed for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

*3. Fear Ray.* *Wisdom Save:* DC 13. *Failure:* The target is Frightened for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

*4. Wounding Ray.* *Constitution Save:* DC 13. *Failure:* 16 (3d10) Necrotic damage. *Success:* Half damage.

### Reactions
***Spell Reflection.*** If the spectator makes a successful saving throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses it, the spectator can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature instead of the spectator. If the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.

# Appendix C: Magic Items

## Helm of Telepathy (Modified)

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This tarnished bronze helm was crafted by Aldric Vorn as an experiment in mental communication. Found in a glass case in the **first-floor workshop**, it gathers dust until the party or the sorcerer realizes its potential. Aldric modifies it specifically for the Kenku fledgling during Act 5.

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the *detect thoughts* spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply (using a bonus action to do so) while your focus on it continues.

**Modification for Kenku:** When worn by a Kenku, this helm allows the wearer to project original thoughts telepathically, bypassing the Kenku curse's restriction on original speech. The Kenku can communicate freely through telepathy, though their audible voice remains limited to mimicry.

:

## Reward Items

The following items may be offered as rewards by the sorcerer or found in the manor:

#### Broom of Flying (Damaged)
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

One of the animated brooms from the festival, now inert. With 8 hours of work and a successful DC 15 Arcana check, it can be repaired into a functional *broom of flying*. On a failed check, the broom remains inert but can be attempted again.

#### Ring of Mind Shielding
*Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*

Found in the sorcerer's study. While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type.

\column

## Treasure

### Part 1 Rewards

| Source | Reward |
|:-------|:-------|
| Village payment | 50 gp |
| Scarecrow components | 10 gp worth of alchemical reagents |
| Gate guardian salvage | 25 gp in scrap metal and enchantment dust |

### Part 2 Rewards

| Source | Reward |
|:-------|:-------|
| Sorcerer's payment | 100 gp |
| Manor exploration | Various small valuables worth 50 gp total |
| Sorcerer's gratitude | One uncommon magic item of DM's choice |

{{note
##### Scaling Rewards
For wealthier campaigns, multiply gold values by 2-3. For lower-magic campaigns, replace the magic item reward with a favor from the sorcerer (a one-time casting of a 3rd-level or lower spell, access to his library for research, etc.).

# Appendix D: Maps

## Manor Overview

The manor is a three-story stone building with **two routes to the cellar**. The party can explore freely; both routes converge at the cellar door.

**Ground Floor:**
- **Foyer** — Main entrance, grand staircase, rug of smothering encounter
- **Sitting room** — Ransacked, alarm-trapped drawer (DC 12 to disarm)
- **Dining room** — Single chair (animates when sat in), lonely details
- **Kitchen** — Enchanted kettle, cellar stairs access (**Route A** to cellar)
- **Study** — Research notes, hidden passage behind bookcase (**Route B** to cellar, DC 14 Investigation)

**First Floor:**
- **Landing** — Overlooks foyer, spectator patrol point
- **Upper hallway** — Dying Kenku
- **Workshop** — Helm of Telepathy in glass case, music box (DC 13 Arcana), half-finished projects
- **Bedchamber** — Unused for years
- **Library** — Magical texts

**Second Floor:**
- Observatory, storage rooms, roof access

**Cellar:**
- Bolt-hole (Kenku survivors), emergency supplies
- Accessible via kitchen stairs (Route A) or study secret passage (Route B)

{{note
##### Map Suggestions
For battle maps, you'll need:
1. **Village festival square** — Open area with stalls, tables, central stage
2. **Manor gate** — Iron gate, gravel path, stone walls
3. **Manor foyer** — Grand entrance with twin staircases, rug in center
4. **Kitchen / cellar stairs** — Route A to cellar door

For theater of the mind, emphasize the **two paths**: left from the foyer leads through the dining room to the kitchen (Route A); right leads to the study and the hidden passage (Route B).

# Appendix E: DM Guidance

## Running the Kenku

The Kenku communication puzzle is the heart of Part 2's emotional core. Some guidance:

**Don't try to have a normal conversation.** The Kenku can't answer open questions easily. They respond to yes/no questions, react to emotional tone, and tell stories through sequences of sound.

**Use sounds from earlier in the session.** If a player said something memorable in the foyer, have the Kenku replay it. This makes the mimicry feel immediate and real.

**Reward creative communication.** If players find inventive ways to communicate (writing under the door, asking only yes/no questions, feeding phrases to repeat back), let it work.

**The emotional beat matters more than the information.** The party doesn't need to understand every detail of the Kenku's story. They need to understand: these are desperate people who came to save a child.

## Scaling the Adventure

### For Fewer Players (3 players)

| Encounter | Adjustment |
|:----------|:-----------|
| Animated Brooms | Reduce to 3 brooms |
| Scarecrow | Remove advantage on Glare save |
| Gate Guardians | Remove the flying sword |
| Rug | Keep as-is (already weakened) |
| Spectator | Reduce HP to 30 |

### For More Players (6+ players)

| Encounter | Adjustment |
|:----------|:-----------|
| Animated Brooms | Add 2 more brooms |
| Scarecrow | Add a second scarecrow at half HP |
| Gate Guardians | Add a second flying sword |
| Rug | Restore to full HP (27) |
| Spectator | Add +10 HP |

\column

## Pacing Notes

### Part 1 Timing

| Act | Target Time | Notes |
|:----|:-----------:|:------|
| Festival + Brooms | 30-40 min | Let players establish characters |
| Road (Harlan Briggs) | 10-15 min | Social encounter, clues |
| Scarecrow | 15-20 min | Combat, can compress if long |
| Gate Encounter | 20-30 min | Full combat |
| Lockdown Scene | 15-20 min | Atmosphere, no dice |
| **Total** | **2.5-3 hours** | |

### Part 2 Timing

| Act | Target Time | Notes |
|:----|:-----------:|:------|
| Foyer + Rug | 15-20 min | Quick combat |
| Exploration (both floors) | 15-25 min | Interactive rooms, roaming spectator |
| Cellar Door Puzzle | 20-30 min | The heart of Part 2 |
| Spectator | 20-30 min | Combat or skill challenge |
| Resolution | 15-20 min | Let it breathe |
| **Total** | **2-2.5 hours** | |

## Safety Notes

This adventure includes:
- Death (a Kenku dies in front of the party)
- A child in danger (the fledgling)
- Themes of grief, desperation, and found family
- A creature (the spectator) that has been psychologically traumatized

Check in with your players if any of these themes are sensitive.

If the scarecrows feel too creepy, swap them for animated festival dolls (use the same stat block). If the dying Kenku scene is too dark, have it already dead when the party arrives and let players infer the rest.

The fledgling's survival is the emotional heart of this adventure. If the party's choices put her in danger, consider having the adult Kenku sacrifice herself to protect the fledgling — one more death to weigh on the party's conscience. A DM who wants a darker tone can let the consequences play out, but be aware this changes the adventure's emotional register significantly.

# When the Sorcerer's Away

A reclusive sorcerer leaves his manor for the first time in a long time. Within hours, everything goes wrong.

Animated brooms attack a village festival. Enchanted scarecrows turn hostile. The manor's defenses seal the building at nightfall, with something trapped inside.

But the chaos wasn't random. Four Kenku broke into the manor, seeking help for a curse that stole their voices. They came for a child who has never spoken an original word. Now one is dead, one is dying, two are trapped, and a confused guardian hunts the halls.

**When the Sorcerer's Away** is a two-session introductory adventure for 4-5 characters, levels 1-3. It teaches core D&D mechanics through escalating encounters while building to an emotional climax that rewards player choice.

Will the party fight their way through, or find another way?
